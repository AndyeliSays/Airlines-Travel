# --Airlines & Travel--

## Introduction:
  
  The airline industry generates vast amounts of data every day, ranging from flight schedules and passenger bookings to aircraft details and ticket sales. Analyzing this data can unlock valuable insights that help airlines improve operational efficiency, optimize revenue, and enhance passenger experience. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to airline operations to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

The dataset consists of several tables (8) which include aircrafts_data, airports_data, boarding_passes, bookings, flights, seat, ticket_flights, tickets.

## Business Task & Objectives: 
  
  The goal of this analysis is to transform raw data into actionable insights that can help airlines make data-driven decisions. This project will leverage SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis. Key metrics such as flight delays, ticket sales per booking, and aircraft utilization will be explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of airline operations. By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a clear summary of findings that can contribute to improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer satisfaction, and identifying areas for revenue optimization within the airline industry.

Some examples of questions, topics addressed but not limited to:
- Which airports are the most visited and what is their revenue? by Month? by Flight?
- How many passengers travel per booking?
- Which routes experience the most delays?
- Which aircraft models are most frequently used?
- What booking class is the most popular?
- Ticket volume and Ticket Sales in Monthly Overview
- Occupancy Rate

## Tools:
- Data cleaning, preparation, analysis done in SQL.
- Data visualizations made in Tableau.
